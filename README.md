Download videos from flograppling on your pc

## Prerequisites

having a pro account en flograppling

### Start

in chrome console check the network when you play the video

you have to find the "playlist.m3u8" file, it's the one that stock all the ts files depending on the resolution 

### Why this project

I'm working by bike/train, but there is no wifi in the train and I wanted to watch videos so I had to found a solution

I really like flograppling but I often have trouble with the network :

When the traffic is slow the player load a low quality video and you can barely see something

I wanted to force the player to show a resolution of 1280 * 720
